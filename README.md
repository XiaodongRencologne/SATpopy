The package will be developed to simulate the optical performance of the simons observatory small aperture telescope by using physcial optics, Kirchhoff diffraction, and Double PO analysis.

The first step is to build a code which can write tor files for TICRA GRAPS. The Method of Moments method will be implemented by GRASP for the telescope. The MoM results will be used as gold standard.

Tools:
1. create geometries, reflector, lens, coordinates, and export to '.tor' file.
2. read geometries from tor file
